# Unreal-Adventure-Game
This was my first dive into how to mix blueprint and C++ scripting in Unreal. The goal of the game is to complete the quests that are listed in your journal on your screen until you reach the end.

The game starts you at your house in which you then must travel to the village nearby to complete some tasks to help the villagers out. These tasks can be anything from moving pumpkins to finding lost items. Once these tasks are done you then can head home to get a long nights rest.

This game was made in Unreal 4.25 and the average playtime of this adventure game is around 15 minutes.
